# Chapter 6: Challenges Ahead

While promising, humanoid AI faces obstacles:

### 6.1 High Cost

Building precise motors, sensors, and advanced AI models is expensive.

### 6.2 Energy Requirements

Robots need powerful batteries and efficient energy systems.

### 6.3 Technical Complexity

Realistic walking, balance, and dexterity are extremely challenging.

### 6.4 Global Regulations

No universal laws define:

- Robot rights
- AI limitations
- Safety standards

Governments must cooperate internationally.
