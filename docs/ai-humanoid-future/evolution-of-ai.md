# Chapter 1: Evolution of Artificial Intelligence

AI began with early experiments in logic and mathematical problem-solving. The first computers could only perform strict, rule-based tasks. Over time, major breakthroughs expanded AI’s capabilities:

### 1.1 Rule-Based Systems

These systems followed fixed instructions. They were predictable but not flexible.

### 1.2 Machine Learning

Machines learned patterns from data instead of following fixed rules.

### 1.3 Deep Learning

Neural networks enabled computers to analyze images, sound, and complex information with human-like accuracy.

### 1.4 Multimodal AI

Models like GPT, Claude, Gemini, and others can now understand text, images, audio, and human intent.
This is the foundation behind modern humanoid intelligence.
