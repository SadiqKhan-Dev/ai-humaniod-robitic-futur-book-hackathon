# AI-Humanoid Future Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clarity and Accessibility
The book must be written in clear, accessible language, avoiding jargon where possible. Complex topics should be broken down into smaller, digestible parts. The target audience is broad, from students to professionals.

### II. Accuracy and Verifiability
All technical information, historical data, and claims must be accurate and verifiable. Sources should be cited where appropriate. Code examples must be tested and functional.

### III. Practicality and Relevance
The content should be practical and relevant to the reader. It should provide real-world examples, case studies, and actionable insights. The focus is on what is possible and what is being developed.

### IV. Engaging and Futuristic Tone
The book should have an engaging and futuristic tone. It should inspire readers and make them think about the future of AI and humanity. The UI and design of the book (if applicable) should reflect this.

### V. Regular Updates and Iterations
The field of AI is constantly evolving. The book should be treated as a living document, with a plan for regular updates and iterations to keep the content current.

## Writing and Style Guide

The book will follow the Microsoft Manual of Style. All content will be reviewed for clarity, grammar, and style before publication.

## Review and Contribution Process

All contributions will be reviewed by at least one other author. A pull request-based workflow will be used for all changes to the book's content.

## Governance

This constitution is the guiding document for the project. Any changes to the constitution must be approved by a majority of the authors.
